                                Passionate about the ocean and sea turtle conservation, he explains, “From the moment baby sea turtles 
                                hatch, they must rely on themselves to crawl about ten meters to reach the ocean! This is nature’s way 
                                of training them because this journey is crucial. It activates the beach imprinting mechanism—an innate 
                                GPS—that helps strengthen their limbs and prepares them with the resilience needed to survive both on 
                                land and in the sea. When they grow up, this imprinting guides them back to their natal beach to lay the 
                                next generation of eggs.”

                                        <p alt="" class="img-fluid">At the age of 26, Sylvia, with her mother’s support, left the comfort 
                                            of her office job in Taipei and embarked on a journey as a backpacker with her then-boyfriend, 
                                            now husband, Henry, the founder and president of H Hotel Group. As an only child who had always 
                                            loved animals and maintained a vegetarian lifestyle, Sylvia dreamed of traveling the world as a 
                                            wildlife conservation volunteer.
                                            “To fulfill my dream, we started our backpacking journey by volunteering with elephants in 
                                            Chiang Mai, Thailand,” she recalls. “As a vegetarian, I always longed to help animals across the 
                                            globe. That experience showed me how the power of love transcends all forms. Being able to help 
                                            these voiceless creatures to the best of my ability is the greatest joy of my life.”</p>

                                By choosing to understand, learning from animals, and seeing them as part of us, we can protect this world a little 
                                more and harm nature a little less. Treating all life with kindness and love is humanity’s most precious value.
                                ” For Sylvia, spiritual fulfillment matters far more than material wealth, and helping animals is the joyful 
                                wellspring that nourishes her deepest sense of purpose.

                                Sylvia initially opened a bubble tea shop, which became successful, and has now transformed into the owner of a 
                                direct-operated Ulong Tea store on Aiyan Island. Meanwhile, Henry ventured into the hospitality industry, and has 
                                since built and managed eight hotels. He also purchased an uninhabited island near Aiyan Island, with plans to 
                                develop it into a resort concept where each island will have its own hotel.

                                Sylvia, who overcame her fear of swimming and embraced a new perspective on life, found a sense of belonging on Aiyan 
                                Island and discovered her life’s mission. "When I first settled on Aiyan Island, I was shocked and angered to learn 
                                that the locals dug up sea turtle eggs from Nacpan to eat. Some believed that eating these eggs could boost their 
                                strength or health due to local folklore," Sylvia recalled. Determined to protect the sea turtles, she and Henry decided 
                                to buy up all the eggs. With their kindness, they wanted to save the world. "At that time, we paid 5 pesos (about 3 TWD) 
                                per egg, spending 1,000 pesos to purchase 150 eggs. We then dug holes on the beach and buried them, thinking this would 
                                allow them to hatch. Little did we know that sea turtle eggs are sensitive to vibrations and shaking, so nearly all of them 
                                died during the process of being moved," she said with a sense of helplessness.

                                Drawing from this experience, Sylvia and Henry established the Nacpan Private Sea Turtle Conservation Center in 2016. 
                                "Today, sea turtles, which are on the brink of extinction, have a survival rate where, on average, only one out of every 
                                1,000 eggs will successfully hatch and make it back to the ocean. After living in the sea for about 12 to 30 years, 
                                they return home to lay eggs and reproduce using their own version of a 'Google Map,'" Sylvia laughed, saying, 
                                "They are truly the 'sea-going' generation."

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                                Sylvia, passionate about increasing the baby sea turtles' survival rate to 1 in 200, first sought help from sea turtle conservation 
                                expert David McCann, whom she met while diving in Sipadan, Malaysia. Through intensive email exchanges, she learned about sea turtle 
                                care. In 2017, she met Philippine ecological conservation expert Jamie Dichaves, who flew to Aiyan Island to teach more detailed and 
                                professional turtle incubation techniques. "Thanks to their passionate support, we were able to gradually establish the baby sea 
                                turtle sanctuary," she said, as they began building the first stage of the turtle hatching area.

                                Sylvia explained that the gender of sea turtles is determined by the temperature during incubation. If the temperature exceeds 28°C (82°F), 
                                the proportion of female turtles increases, which can lead to ecological imbalance. "In 2018, we moved to a second location, renting land 
                                along Nacpan Beach. We started creating turtle egg nests using wooden boxes. Compared to the previous method of digging holes in the sand 
                                and covering them with fences, this provides more security and privacy, and better protects the eggs from risks such as being dug up by 
                                humans, dogs, cats, snakes, crabs, ants, lizards, and other predators."
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                                That same year, the center evolved from simple sand pits to wooden boxes and became the highest turtle hatch rate conservation center in Palawan, 
                                the Philippines. However, they hadn’t anticipated that the local government would install electric poles near the conservation area, and the nighttime 
                                lighting directly impacted the hatching process. They had to relocate again, which led to the current setup. "But building the conservation area 
                                wasn’t the end; it also needed maintenance and management. Additionally, wooden boxes used for turtle egg nests were vulnerable to termites, 
                                which would breed in the wood and kill many newly hatched sea turtles," Sylvia said, choking up. "It was truly terrifying, and every year we have to 
                                put a lot of effort into rechecking and preventing termite infestations."

                                "Let’s look at the same life from different perspectives!" Sylvia reflects on her relationship with the world and nature. "I have an ideal vision
                                 for a sea turtle conservation center in my heart. It’s not only about successfully hatching more sea turtles, but also having the ability to 
                                 provide medical care for injured or disabled turtles. Additionally, considering the impact of global warming on turtle hatching, we are currently 
                                 constructing a cement hatching area with cooling functions." From 2016, when they successfully hatched and released 253 turtles back into 
                                 the ocean, to 2023, when the number of hatchlings reached 10,331, a total of 48,663 baby sea turtles have been hatched and released over eight years.   
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                                "It takes about two months for sea turtle eggs to hatch. As the eggs are about to break, we need to patrol 24/7, taking turns, to quickly find the 
                                baby turtles that have finished hatching. We then help them return to the ocean as naturally as possible to avoid suffocation, as their strength is 
                                limited." From the initial team of just Sylvia and Henry at the sea turtle conservation center, it has now grown to include eight professional 
                                conservationists, all dedicated to the cause.

                                When the cute baby turtles, hatched and ready to go, struggle to crawl and swim back to their ocean home, Sylvia and Henry are still moved to tears.

                                However, during the ten years of settling on El Nido Island, the most heartbreaking experience for him was still seeing sea turtles tragically 
                                dying on the beach, their shells ruthlessly taken by unscrupulous traders. What was even more infuriating was the presence of illegal turtle-catching 
                                boats capturing large numbers of sea turtles. On the sea, it was not uncommon to see turtle carcasses floating with their bodies filled with plastic 
                                debris, which was incredibly sad. To prevent these human-made tragedies from happening again, they invested more funds into sea turtle conservation. 
                                In 2017, to support the costs, they opened a beachfront restaurant and bar, SUNMAI, using the profits to fund various conservation expenses for sea turtles.

                                Sylvia reminded divers to maintain a safe distance from the sea turtles and not touch them, as this could cause bacterial infections for the turtles. 
                                The turtles would also be frightened, missing the chance to surface for air, and could even fail to return to their original marine habitat, leading 
                                to death or injury.

                                When releasing baby sea turtles, they need to be gently held by the edges of their shells using the thumb and index finger, as their shells are very fragile.

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                                Continuing her efforts for sea turtle conservation and marine ecology, Sylvia also faced the global COVID-19 pandemic. With the Philippines in lockdown, 
                                the island lost its visitors, and the restaurant-bar could no longer generate income to support the sea turtle conservation center. "But the sea turtle 
                                mothers don’t stop laying eggs because of the current predicament," Sylvia said. At that time, she was extremely worried that the efforts of five years 
                                of conservation would be interrupted. In order to not betray her original intention to protect sea turtles, she, who had never accepted any donations, 
                                decided to launch a fundraising campaign after struggling for a year and a half. She set up a website called "Turtle Love El Nido" and initiated the 
                                "Sea Turtle Adoption Program." To her surprise, people from all over the world responded. Since then, every year during the Nacpan Sea Turtle Season in 
                                November and December, the adoption program has been open, but once the funds are raised, online fundraising stops.

                                conservation. In addition to drawing educational murals about sea turtles at the conservation center, she also visited local residents and fishermen 
                                door-to-door, as well as entering elementary schools to promote the concept of sea turtle conservation. To help more people learn about sea turtles 
                                and the importance of sustainable natural environments, and to raise awareness for ecological conservation, she organized an exclusive 
                                "Sea Turtle Limited Tour" through her company, "Deeply in Love with El Nido ElnidoGo Travel Agency." This tour, limited to only three groups a year, 
                                takes place during the hatching season from February to May. Sylvia personally leads the group to visit the conservation center and experience the 
                                emotional moment when baby sea turtles are released into the ocean. The tour also includes island-hopping to visit secret, unexplored spots, 
                                where participants can enjoy the beach while cleaning it up, and during diving trips, they remove the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish that causes 
                                coral bleaching, adding meaningful actions to the journey.

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Always believing that destiny has the best plans, Sylvia recalls another experience of self-healing during the pandemic: 
                                "Accepting every moment of stillness, the intentional or unintentional revelations and voices, I realized that plans can’t keep up with the ever-changing 
                                nature of life. Perhaps it was the right time to once again open my heart and senses, driving my love for music to start learning DJing from scratch with 
                                a teacher." She laughs, saying that she finally unlocked the achievement she had been working toward and officially became a House DJ. This year (2024), 
                                she even performed on the main stage at the Palawan Annual Music Festival and created her first original song, Heat Run, inspired by her experience swimming 
                                with humpback whales in Tonga, reaching a personal milestone.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">"Everyone must have their own strengths and missions. Finding a path that fills you with vitality and happiness is truly a 
                                wonderful thing in life!" Sylvia, using her hands to help both herself and others, continues to face the pressures of ocean conservation. When emotional 
                                lows come and she feels overwhelmed, she turns to music as a way to release stress. For her, "Saving sea turtles and DJing are complementary streams.
                                " At this moment, under the pink sunset on Nacpan Beach, Sylvia smiles and says, "In the circle of life influencing life and protecting the ocean, 
                                I have already gained the most valuable wealth in the world!"
