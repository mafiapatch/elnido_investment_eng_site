                                united by a shared love for music. As the first hospitality choir in El Nido, it embodies the spirit of HHG employees, 
                                bringing together members from all our locations—Town, Lio, and Nacpan—to create harmonious melodies.</p>
                            <p>The choir made its debut on August 18, 2024, at the hotel basketball friendly match, opening the event with a heartfelt 
                                rendition of the national anthem. This performance brought pride to HHG and joy to everyone in attendance. 
                                Composed of 13 employees from various HHG departments, the choir introduced the sound of music to El Nido.</p>
                            <p>More than just a choir, the HHG Choir is a testament to our commitment to work-life balance and employee engagement. 
                                Through this initiative, our employees have found new ways to express themselves, connect with colleagues, and bring 
                                their passions into the workplace. With the support of the HR department, the choir reinforces our belief that HHG is 
                                more than just a workplace—it is a vibrant community where everyone has a voice. As the choir continues to grow, 
                                they are already preparing for upcoming performances, further strengthening their connection with the greater El Nido 
                                community.</p>
